# Neovim LSP code actions diagnostics bug repro

This repository is a minimal reproduction of a bug I've encountered with
Neovim's LSP client, where diagnostics are not correctly sent to the LSP
servers.

See <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/30001> for more information and
reproduction steps.

The bug has been fixed, so the repository is archived.
